<Warning>
    Remember to keep your API key a secret, they are essentially your password. Do not share them with others or expose it in client-side code.
    You can always revoke an exposed API key.
</Warning>

The Delaphone API uses API keys for authentication. All API requests must include your API key in an `Authorization` HTTP header as follows:
```text
Authorization: Bearer DELAPHONE_API_KEY
```
