You can interact with the API through HTTP requests from any language, via our official Python bindings,
our official Node.js library, or a community-maintained library.

## Authentication
The Delaphone API uses API keys for authentication.
**Remember that your API key is a secret!** Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps).
Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable
or key management service. All API requests must include your API key in an `Authorization` HTTP header as follows:
```text
Authorization: Bearer DELAPHONE_API_KEY
```

## Resources
